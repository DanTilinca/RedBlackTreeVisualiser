# RedBlackTreeVisualiser

## Introduction
This project is a visualizer for Red-Black Trees (RBTree), implemented in Python. Red-Black Trees are a kind of self-balancing binary search tree, a data structure used in computer science, typically used to implement associative arrays. Each node of the tree has an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black. A red-black tree satisfies the following red-black properties:
1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. All leaves (NIL nodes) are black.
4. If a red node has children then, both its children are black.
5. Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes goes through the same number of black nodes.

These properties ensure the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
